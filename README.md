# Cancer-Diagnosis-Analysis-Using-Python-ML-
Here a clear insight is predicted using classification ML models for diagnose a cancer patient.For that two cases were analysed one is Malignant Cancer/Benign cancer.
Malignant cancer grows rapidly throughout the body wereas Benign cancer grows slowly.Using this basic infomations some records are trained and tested using ML models like K-NEAREST NEIGHORS & NAIVE BAYES ALGORITHM.
Finally this gives a good prediction regarding the patient is either falls in any one of the two cases.Through this diagnose is done in better manner.Basic python programming is used for creating the ML model.
Accuracy is quite good in this both algorithm analysis.
